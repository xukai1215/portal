Some models represent the general laws of the natural world, while some models are aimed at specific problems in a certain field. Now, in the face of a large number of geographic models, it is difficult to find relevant models that fit our research direction, so we need to classify the models. According to the different characteristics of geographic models, we designed a three-tier classification to meet the needs of users to discover different types of models.
