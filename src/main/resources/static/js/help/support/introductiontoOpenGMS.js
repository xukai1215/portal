It is of great importance to integrate various resources to conduct comprehensive simulations and experiments to understand complex geographical phenomena and processes. Aiming at solving complex geographical problems, as well as improving the theories and technologies on open geographical modelling, integration and simulation, we proposed the open framework on \"Scene-based collaboratively geographic modeling - Service-oriented distributed resource sharing - Process-rooted resource integration and simulation\" and corresponding implementation scheme. The open geographic modeling and simulation platform (OpenGMS), which can be employed by multi-discipline users through network to solve complex geographic problems and conduct integrated simulation, is developed accordingly.</p>\n<p>Mission: Providing a comprehensive geographic problem solving platform that can be used transparently, efficiently and collaboratively</p>\n<p>Vision: Building a simulation resource integration and reuse community in an open, cooperative and win-win way</p>\n<p>Objective: Developing open style-based geographic modeling, simulation theories and technologies</p>\n"}, {"title": "2 What can I do in OpenGMS", "content": "<p> OpenGMS supports sharing of your modeling and simulation resources for geographic applications.
